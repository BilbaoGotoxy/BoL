A multilayer perceptron is a feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs.
It consists of multiple layers of nodes in a directed graph, with each layer fully connected to the next one.
Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron (or processing element) with a nonlinear activation function.
It is a modification of the standard linear perceptron and can distinguish data that are not linearly separable.
